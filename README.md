# guess-the-specificity

I wrote an [article](https://dev.to/ibn_abubakre/css-specificity-explained-1134) on dev.to concerning CSS specificity and I decided to come up with the fun game that allows you to test your knowledge of CSS specificity.

The CSS selectors in the game is for educational purposes only and as such might not be the most appropriate.

## Todo
 - [x] Generate random CSS selectors
 - [x] Calculate specificity and check score
 - [ ] Random success message
 - [ ] Come up with a better UI
 - [ ] Add extra ids, classes, tags name and pseudo classes
 - [ ] Add support for attribute selectors
 - [ ] Add difficulties

## Project setup

### Install dependencies

* npm: `npm install`
* yarn: `yarn`

### Start Dev Server

* npm: `npm run dev`
* yarn: `yarn dev`

### Build for production and launch server

* npm:
  ```bash
    npm run build
    npm run start
  ```
* yarn:
  ```bash
    yarn build
    yarn start
  ```
