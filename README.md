# guess-the-specificity

I wrote an [article](https://dev.to/ibn_abubakre/css-specificity-explained-1134) on dev.to concerning CSS specificity and I decided to come up with the fun game that allows you to test your knowledge of CSS specificity.

The CSS selectors in the game is for educational purposes only and as such might not be the most appropriate.

*To make the CSS selectors more random, you can check the [db folder](https://github.com/Abdulqudus001/guess-the-specificity/tree/master/db) to add more CSS selectors*
